          <h1>on locking in</h1>
            <h2>2025-03-24</h2>
        
          <p>my end to 2024 was with travel - hopping around europe for most of november and spending the new year in south west WA. this was an opportunity to feel more in-control than i do for most of my day to day life and reflect on my short term goals. most people have projects, passions and hobbies they've been <em>meaning</em> to get into, but haven't yet. personally, this is one of my biggest stresses in life. i'm not burdened with the fear of &quot;wasting my twenties&quot; - rather, one of my biggest aspirations for late life is to <strong>have something to show for it</strong>.</p>
<p>there are plenty of people i've met who seem predisposed to &quot;locking in&quot; - each time you see them they've caught the headwind of three new skills and sailed the course of some marvellous new project. to know these people is a privilege - they inspire and motivate me to investigate and learn about new things. but to put people in a special advanced bucket for what i count as their accomplishments - is reductive. in contrast to the locking-in personality type, i feel more built to hang out.</p>
<p>being put on this earth to hang out is pretty awesome too &lt;3</p>
