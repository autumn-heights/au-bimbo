          <p>&quot;you are a crab and amelia earhart is dead&quot; is a one-page ttrpg i wrote in mid-2020 in the midst of lockdowns. it's a transparent clone of <a href="https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings">lasers and feelings</a> by john harper. this is because, at the time, i had no idea you could write any other kind of one-page rpg.</p>
<p>it features a nice crab photograph that, to my knowledge, originates from <a href="https://museum.wa.gov.au/explore/blogs/andrew-hosie/theyre-using-coconuts">andrew hosie's blog on the western australian museum website</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241016050836/https://museum.wa.gov.au/explore/blogs/andrew-hosie/theyre-using-coconuts">internet archive</a>).
<strong>EDIT:</strong> i've just noticed the alt text on the image credits <a href="https://visit.museum.wa.gov.au/dr-zoe-richards">dr zoe richards</a>!!</p>

<p>after writing it i ran several sessions of this game for <a href="https://unigames.ucc.asn.au">unigames</a>, both online and in-person due to lockdowns. memorably, the players demonstrated that min-maxing into the largest, most brutish coconut crab was the strongest possible option.</p>
<p>it's a simple project but something i'm proud of to this day - it's still in the unigames library and i'm aware of it being played during one-page ttrpg oneshot nights.</p>
