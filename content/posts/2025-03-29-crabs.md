"you are a crab and amelia earhart is dead" is a one-page ttrpg i wrote in mid-2020 in the midst of lockdowns. it's a transparent clone of [lasers and feelings](https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings) by john harper. this is because, at the time, i had no idea you could write any other kind of one-page rpg.


it features a nice crab photograph that, to my knowledge, originates from [andrew hosie's blog on the western australian museum website](https://museum.wa.gov.au/explore/blogs/andrew-hosie/theyre-using-coconuts) ([internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20241016050836/https://museum.wa.gov.au/explore/blogs/andrew-hosie/theyre-using-coconuts)).

after writing it i ran several sessions of this game for [unigames](https://unigames.ucc.asn.au), both online and in-person due to lockdowns. memorably, the players demonstrated that min-maxing into the largest, most brutish coconut crab was the strongest possible option.

it's a simple project but something i'm proud of to this day - it's still in the unigames library and i'm aware of it being played during one-page ttrpg oneshot nights.
