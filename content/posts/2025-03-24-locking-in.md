my end to 2024 was with travel - hopping around europe for most of november and spending the new year in south west WA. this was an opportunity to feel more in-control than i do for most of my day to day life and reflect on my short term goals. most people have projects, passions and hobbies they've been *meaning* to get into, but haven't yet. personally, this is one of my biggest stresses in life. i'm not burdened with the fear of "wasting my twenties" - rather, one of my biggest aspirations for late life is to **have something to show for it**.

there are plenty of people i've met who seem predisposed to "locking in" - each time you see them they've caught the headwind of three new skills and sailed the course of some marvellous new project. to know these people is a privilege - they inspire and motivate me to investigate and learn about new things. but to put people in a special advanced bucket for what i count as their accomplishments - is reductive. in contrast to the locking-in personality type, i feel more built to hang out.

being put on this earth to hang out is pretty awesome too <3
